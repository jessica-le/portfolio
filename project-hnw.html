        <section>
            <p>designed the strategic vision and frameworks for a major canadian bank's high net worth wealth management experience—defining everything from relationship management tiers to digital product mvp.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>my role:</strong> strategy consultant & framework designer</p>
            <p><strong>team:</strong> worked directly with vp of high net worth experience and cross-functional stakeholders</p>
            <p><strong>timeline:</strong> 9 months strategy development</p>

            <h2>the opportunity</h2>
            
            <p>identified a $1b market opportunity in the high net worth segment through client interviews and competitive research. existing platforms weren't serving clients who wanted both human advisory relationships and digital self-service capabilities.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>what i designed</h2>
            
            <h3>relationship management framework</h3>
            <p>this was the work i'm most proud of. designed a framework that defined service tiers and advisory touchpoints across different client segments and lines of business. it started with the vp, moved to senior leadership socialization, then got applied across the entire organization to inform their cross-selling strategy.</p>
            
            <p>the framework gave everyone shared language for how to serve high net worth clients consistently. wealth advisors and tech teams could finally align on what "high-touch service" actually meant in practice.</p>
            
            <h3>product vision & mvp roadmap</h3>
            <p>led workshops to define the digital product vision. prioritized features across three mvp phases based on user needs, technical feasibility, and business value. helped the bank think about wealth management apps not as feature lists but as relationship-building tools.</p>
            
            <h3>strategic frameworks & diagrams</h3>
            <p>spent significant time designing visual frameworks and diagrams that made complex strategy legible. built slide decks that senior leadership could actually use to make decisions and communicate vision across departments.</p>

            <h2>the outcome</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>established product roadmap targeting initial $300m revenue from identified $1b opportunity</li>
                <li>relationship management framework adopted across wealth advisory organization</li>
                <li>aligned cross-functional stakeholders (wealth advisors, tech, operations) around customer-centric strategy</li>
                <li>defined clear mvp scope that balanced user needs with technical constraints</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>what this taught me</h2>
            
            <p>the most satisfying work was having autonomy to design frameworks that people could actually use—not just recommendations that get filed away. watching senior leadership adopt and apply the relationship management framework felt like evidence that good design thinking creates shared understanding.</p>
            
            <p>in fintech, especially wealth management, trust is the core product. every strategic decision needed to reinforce credibility and security for clients used to white-glove service. the best product strategies emerge from understanding that intersection of user needs, business constraints, and market realities.</p>
